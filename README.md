# Brevity Buddy

(for now) Firefox extension.

Summarize a page by clicking on the extension icon.

## How to use

- Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click on `Load Temporary Add-on`, then select any file in the extension folder
- Go to your extension preferences, by right clicking on the extension, and add your OpenAI key
- Click on the extension icon when you want to summarize!

## Limitations

- Does not handle a page that is too long.
- Summary is currently in a popup, which is not ideal.
